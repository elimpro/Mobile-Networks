# Models for real mobile networks

The purpose of this project is to analyze the properties of different mobiles networks and compare the results to the ones obtained on mobile networks generated by the edge-Markovian evolving graph model.

We decided to code in Python, and present the code in a Jupyter Notebook "Notebook_mobile_networks". Thus, to reproduce our experiments, you need to install Jupyter (provided with the Anaconda distribution) and open the notebook in Jupyter Notebook or the experimental Jupyter Lab.

Package requirements:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
time
sklearn

To install these packages, please run the following line in a python terminal:
```
pip install numpy pandas matplotlib time sklearn
```

Then open Jupyter Notebook running:
```
jupyter notebook
```

Then you should run all the cells one by one (some of them may take some time to compute, but we stored the results of the longest one to avoid running it everytime we open the notebook).

*Remark:*
If you do not want to install Jupyter notebook, our notebook is available for reading at the following url :
